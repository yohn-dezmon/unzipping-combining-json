# Unzipping and Extracting JSON files

The scripts jsonExtractCombine.py and unzip.py will be used in my climate-policy project  
to unzip the collection of zip files for each congress, and then to extract the  
data.json files for each bill for the 'hr' and 's' files representing bills updated  
by either the house or the senate.

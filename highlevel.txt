I need to extract the data.json files from the directory

bill --> hr (or s) --> hr# (or s#) --> data.json

After I extract the json, I should add it to a list (maybe)
Then I need to take that list and add each of the json files to a master json file.


After I write it to another json file, I need to repeat the process (for each "bill" folder
within the master folder).

The master (example) directory is here:

/Users/HomeFolder/Desktop/CongressBills

I should use a virtual environment...
let's create a new one...
how do we do that again?

so I have pip, and I have virtualenv....

the other virtual environments are located at: /Users/HomeFolder/.venvs
so let's go there first then in terminal...
$ virtualenv /Users/HomeFolder/.venvs/jsonCombine

ok good it is there!

how do I activate it?

$ . ~/.venvs/jsonCombine/bin/activate

how do I DL packages?

$ pip install pkg
